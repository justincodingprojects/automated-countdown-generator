# Automated Countdown Generator by Justin Coding Projects (Skills)
This is the repository for an ongoing project for an automated countdown generator website that created for counting down school periods/blocks at my school.

# P.S.A for people still looking here
This repo will be closed on Sep. 15, and will be replaced with the [REBORN](https://www.github.com/justincodingprojects/automated-countdown-generator-reborn)
Accidentally added the file into wrong repo...whoops
Ik the website is down, and will never be up, because Freenom is being a piece of $h!t
