# Auto. Countdown Generator by Justin Coding Projects (Skills)
This is the repository for an ongoing project for an automated countdown generator that generates an URL for the user to click on to see the countdown for the current period they are currently are in.

# How to use

ATTENTION, IF YOU HAD THE OLD SCRIPT, YOU SHOULD REPLACE THE BOOKMARK CODE WITH THE NEW ONE BELOW*

Drag this link into the bookmark:

```javascript:fetch('https://justincodingprojects.github.io/automated-countdown-generator/assets/js/stable/script-stable.js').then(r=>r.text()).then(t=>(new Function(t))())```

*this is just an effort for me to have three different levels of stableness (stable, beta, and dev).
